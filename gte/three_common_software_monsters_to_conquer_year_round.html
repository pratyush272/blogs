    <div class="bg-white p-6 mt-4">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Halloween, with its various names like 'All Hallows', 'Eve', and 'Samhain', often invokes images of Trick or Treat. In this scenario, it feels like someone played a trick on us by asking for a seasonal blog. But fear not; we're in for a treat as we explore some recurring software monsters and how to tame them.</p>

<div class="bg-white p-6 mt-4">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Michael Myers: Avoiding Seasonal Scares</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Michael Myers is a character known for his terrifying and punctual appearances. He remains dormant for months and then suddenly reemerges, causing chaos. Similarly, in the software world, we face our own annual monsters, like Black Friday or the end of the tax year. These events can wreak havoc on system performance. To combat them efficiently, follow these tips:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2">
        <li class="text-gray-700">Regularly update and maintain your systems. Frequent maintenance increases reliability.</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700">Avoid long change freezes as they can accumulate risks.</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700">Design systems for horizontal scalability, taking advantage of modern cloud platforms and container-based solutions.</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700">Utilize downtime to improve quality and scalability, preparing for the next encounter with "Mike."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Frankenstein's Monster: Losing Control of Your (Complex) Creation</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Mary Shelley's Frankenstein tells the story of a doctor who loses control of his creation, leading to chaos and regret. In the software realm, we often encounter Frankenstein-like systems that try to do too much, use numerous technologies, and become overly complex. To avoid this monster:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2">
        <li class="text-gray-700">Keep your systems simple and aligned with current customer needs.</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700">Choose technologies that suit the task at hand, avoiding unnecessary complexity.</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700">Maintain humility and avoid letting ego take over, recognizing that complexity can be the true monster.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="bg-white p-6 mt-4">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. The Invisible Man: Hey, Where'd He Come From?!</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Kevin Bacon's portrayal of the Invisible Man in "Hollow Man" showcases the fear of unpredictability. Similarly, some software systems behave unpredictably due to a lack of tests, alerts, or visibility. To defeat this invisible menace:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2">
        <li class="text-gray-700">Make your system visible by implementing tests, alerts, and dashboards.</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700">Ensure you are aware of any issues before customers encounter them.</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700">Improve operability and add unit tests to stay ahead of potential problems.</li>
    </ul>
