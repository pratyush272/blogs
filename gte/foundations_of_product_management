        <h2>Key Skills for Product Managers</h2>
        <p>Product managers require a diverse skill set to excel in their roles. These skills can be categorized into several essential areas:</p>
        <h3>1. Strategic Thinking</h3>

        <h3>2. Communication</h3>

        <h2>Fundamentals of Creating a User-Centric Product</h2>
        <p>Building a user-centric product is the ultimate goal of product management. To achieve this, product managers should follow a set of fundamental principles:</p>

            <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Regularly conduct usability testing to evaluate how well your product meets user expectations. Identify pain points and areas for improvement and prioritize them accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Establish feedback loops with users through surveys, user forums, and customer support channels. Actively listen to their feedback and use it to drive product enhancements.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Functional Collaboration:</strong> Collaborate closely with design and engineering teams to ensure that user-centric principles are integrated into the product development process from the outset.</li>
